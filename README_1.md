# readme-generator
A README Generator app.

## Description
The app allows users to generate a README file by asking a set of questions; the following README sections are then auto-generated based on the user's responses:

- Project title
- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions

## Dependencies
The app uses the following external Javascript libraries:

[node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

(Install locally using the **npm install** command. Version 16.0.0 or above is recommended.)

[inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

NB use npm install --save inquirer@<version>

## Limitations
The storage capability of the app is determined by the browser's local storage size. It should be noted that some browsers, particularly older ones, may not permit local data storage; in which case the user may wish to switch to one that does.

The app shows a limited number of data points. A future upgrade would consider adding other data points and a weather map to improve the visual affect and provide more weather detail.
